Starting Our Concept List
Let’s add the first term to our list. What do we mean by “the network”?

We use “the network” to refer to the internet—the global system of interconnected computer networks that many of us interact with everyday. If you think about it, the internet is composed of many small networks like the one in your home, office networks, and networks that connect neighborhoods and cities. By using “the network”, we have access to a wealth of information at our fingertips.

Concept List
Network — the global system of interconnected computer networks from which we can access data.
Network — the system of interconnected computer networks from which we can access data.

Data — images, text, video, or any media that can be used by our apps.

Protocol — a way of communicating; standard operating procedure; the rules for communication

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) — a protocol or “handshake” that defines how messages (and data) are sent and received by computers; the underlying protocol for the World Wide Web

Client — a computer that requests data (or services) from a server

Server — a computer that provides data (or services) to a client upon request

HTTP request — a request for data (or a resource) that a client makes to a server; there are various types of HTTP requests called “HTTP methods”

URL (Uniform Resource Locator) — specifies the location for retrieving data over the web; can be thought of as the name of a file on the World Wide Web, because it usually refers to a file on some machine on the network

HTTP method — specifies the type of HTTP request that is being made; in this course, we will also call these (HTTP) request types

HTTP status code — a number returned in response to an HTTP request which indicates the result of the request; you may also hear these referred to as “response codes” or “status messages." Here is a nice listing of different HTTP status codes. (https://httpstatuses.com/)
