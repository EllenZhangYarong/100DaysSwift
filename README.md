### Debugging Lingo
- When solving (and sharing) bugs, it is important to know the right lingo! Being able to describe your bug precisely is key (especially when talking to developers)!

1. logic error: a bug in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly, but not to terminate abnormally (or crash)
2. runtime errors: issues that occur while your application is runningâ€”these can be logic errors or errors that cause your application to crash
3. software bug: an error, flaw, failure, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways
4. static (or compilation) errors: issues identified by the compiler that must be fixed prior to running your application
5 .warning: issues that might cause problems or have unintended side-effects on your running application
